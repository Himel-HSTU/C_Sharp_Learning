# 📘 C# Learning Journey

This repository contains my **daily C# learning practice and notes**, based on:
- Video lessons (Tim Corey C# Mastercourse)
- My own experiments
- Deep understanding of **why things work**, not just how

Each file is written in a **note-style format**, with detailed comments so that I can revisit and understand the concepts later.
